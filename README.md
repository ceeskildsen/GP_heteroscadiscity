orthogonality_constrained_pls
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of Orthogonality-Constrained Partial Least Squares (OC-PLS) regression. The method enhances selectivity by forcing the latent-variable space to be orthogonal to known interfering signals, making it particularly useful in chemometric modeling of vibrational spectroscopy data.

üîß Usage
Function call:
[b, W, P, q, T] = pls_cons(X, y, LV, Sk);

Inputs:

X: n√óp matrix of mean-centered predictors

y: n√ó1 mean-centered response vector

LV: number of latent variables to extract

Sk: p√ók matrix of known interfering signals

Outputs:

b: regression vector

W, P, q, T: standard PLS model matrices

Example (pseudo-code):
% Define or load your data
x = [...]; % training inputs
y = [...]; % training outputs
x_test = [...]; % test inputs

% Define your kernel, e.g. RBF
kernel = @(X1,X2,Œ∏) rbfKernel(X1,X2,Œ∏);

% Run OC-PLS
[b, W, P, q, T] = pls_cons(x, y, LV, Sk);

üõ† Requirements
MATLAB R2021a or later (should work on older versions too)

Optimization Toolbox (for fmincon) or equivalent optimizer
